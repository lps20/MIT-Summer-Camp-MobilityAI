# STGCN-PyTorch
PyTorch implementation of the spatio-temporal graph convolutional network proposed in [Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks: A Deep Learning Framework for Traffic Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04875) by Bing Yu, Haoteng Yin, Zhanxing Zhu. An example for traffic forecasting is included in this repository.

Alternative implementations using other deep learning frameworks can be found here:
  * [TensorFlow](https://github.com/PKUAI26/STGCN-IJCAI-18) by [PKUAI26](https://github.com/PKUAI26)
  * [MXNet](https://github.com/Davidham3/STGCN) by [Davidham3](https://github.com/Davidham3)
  
 ## Requirements
  
  * PyTorch
  * NumPy
  * Matplotlib
  
 ## Example Dataset
  
The repository provides a usage example on the METR-LA dataset (original version to be found [here](https://github.com/liyaguang/DCRNN)). Unfortunately, there is no publicly available standard version of the PeMSD dataset used in the paper.
